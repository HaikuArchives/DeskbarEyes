Deskbar is watching you!

This is the BeOS r5 version of DeskbarEyes_neue_About-Box_letzte_version with fixed 16Ã—16 icon.

DeskbarEyes is a Desktop applet that puts a pair of eyes in your deskbar that follow your cursor. Preferences are not working in Haiku.

There is supposed to be a version 0.2 If anyone has this, please send it for packaging! 

Menu position: Desktop applets
